## About

Al Qaws - a constellation, as well as the Arabic transliteration for 'The Bow' - is a Pricing Intelligence company, aimed at solving a very precise problem: Setting of prices for products.

Whilst companies often go with their gut-feelings or quick analyses in order to price their products, we take pride in delivering a holistic approach to establish prices smartly, relying on knowledge about economics, customer preferences, and your competition's strategies.
